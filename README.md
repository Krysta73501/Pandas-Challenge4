School Performance Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes school performance metrics such as average math and reading scores, as well as passing rates across different schools. The analysis explores the impact of factors like school spending per student, school size, and school type on academic achievement.

Analysis
The analysis is conducted using Python programming language and the pandas library for data manipulation.
Various calculations are performed to derive insights, including average scores, passing rates, and comparisons based on school size and type.
Conclusions
Smaller schools tend to have higher average scores and passing rates compared to larger schools.
Charter schools exhibit better academic performance compared to district schools.
